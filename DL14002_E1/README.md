In this project we had to create a classifier for students who are going to fail or pass based on 16 features that we trained our model on.

This model was totally hand coded to the scratch. 2,3 and 5 layers of relu and sigmoid activation as output, zero and random initializations.

as said before all forward and backward codes were hand coded.
