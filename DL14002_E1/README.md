In this project, we were given the task of creating a classification for students who intend to fail or pass their course based on the 16 features on which we trained our model on.

This model was totally hand coded to the scratch. 2,3 and 5 layers of relu and sigmoid activation as output, zero and random initializations. (No framework used)

As said before all forward and backward codes were hand coded.
