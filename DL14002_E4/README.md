In this project, we were given a dataset with three columns: Sentece1, Sentence2 and Similarity score.

Firstly we extracted the subject of sentences using [Hazm library](https://github.com/sobhe/hazm) and put them into 6 classes: Men, Woman, Children, Animals, Others and Not same subjects.

Then we used a single Network to both predict the similarity score and class of sentences subjects, this network basically had two inputs (sentence1 and sentece2) and 11 nodes output(6 for sentence class and 5 for similarity score)
